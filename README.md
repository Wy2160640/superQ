# superQ

superQ is a pipeline built for analysis  of PEM-seq data. PEM-seq is a next-generation sequencing method to quantify editing efficiency of CRISPR systems by introducing a random molecular barcode systems.

## Getting Started

superQ consists of three parts:

1.Reads Preprocessing

2.
### Prerequisites


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
